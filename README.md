# Seequencer

**Seequencer** is a virtual-reality (VR) app for Android and iOS<sup>*</sup>, built using the [Google Cardboard XR Plugin for Unity](https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard-xr-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file). All in-game assets are created with free and open-source software; [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for 2D assets, [Blender](https://www.blender.org) for 3D assets, and [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) for audio. This project is developed on a MacBook Pro (Intel, 2020) running macOS Sonoma with an iPhone 14 running iOS 17 Developer Beta.

<sup>* Linux, macOS, and Windows, alongside WebGL, are also supported.</sup>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **macOS** has a known issue, please follow the instructions below for a workaround:

### Difficulty Modes

There are three difficulty modes:

1. **Easy**: 6 pads
2. **Normal**: 24 pads
3. **Hard**: 54 pads
