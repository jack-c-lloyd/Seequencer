# Seequencer

**Seequencer** is a virtual-reality (VR) app for Android and iOS, built using the [Google Cardboard XR Plugin for Unity](https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard-xr-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file). All in-game assets are created with free and open-source software; [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for 2D assets, [Blender](https://www.blender.org) for 3D assets, and [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) for audio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Configuration**: this project is developed on a MacBook Pro (Intel, 2020) with an iPhone 14; it is preconfigured for iOS builds (refer to the [Quickstart for Google Cardboard for Unity](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart) for Android build configurations).

## Gameplay

Players are challenged to a memory test: remember successively longer sequences of coloured light-up pads inside of an inverted puzzle-cube, but don’t make too many mistakes!

### Difficulty Modes

There are three difficulty modes:

1. **Easy**: 6 pads
2. **Normal**: 24 pads
3. **Hard**: 54 pads
